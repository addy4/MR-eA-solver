1. readCapacity(int* capacities_mr)
- defined in pcea-solution.c
- capacities = capacities_mr
- Here, capacities is DS declared in pcea-solution.h 
- readData is replaced by readCapacity for reading the capacities of warehouses in reduced instance

- DO: capacities_pcea to be replaced by global var capacities -> done
- Verify: capacities vector displayed by PcEA should be same as capacities_pcea displayed by MR-eA-solver

- Basically, instance's (reduced_instance's) capacities vector info should be transffered to pcea block

After 7th May 1PM --> 

> Embed that part of PcEA where converted data is being used by PcEA to solve problem
> Right now, block is taking the original_instance as input and running PCEA on original_instance
> Need to convert it such that block takes reduced instance and then it will be expanded.
